#ABOUT

<p>Well,this is been made as i follow a tuto made by this guy <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/TheChernoProject">Here</a></p></br>
<p>It's a cool project, a little setup for OpenGL,along with the use of ImGui</p> </br>
<p>So you can debug somethings with a GUI, helps a lot when you want to change values in the code</p> </br>
<p>Maybe one day i make a decent ReadMe explaining how to setup it properly<p>
<p>But hey, clone it and give it a go, i will only not pass the binaries to this repo (and the static linked libraries)</p> </br>
<p>This project uses "glew-2.1.0", "GLFW" (static linking), and "glm", "imgui", "stb_image"(source code or header-only)</p>
<p> The static's are in the "dependences/" folder, the other on the "src/vendor/" </p>
